# PokÃ©mon Multi-Agent System

LLM-powered question-answering system for PokÃ©mon-related queries, built with a multi-agent architecture.

This project implements a specialized AI system designed to answer questions about PokÃ©mon, with particular focus on analyzing hypothetical battle scenarios. The system uses multiple specialized LLM agents that coordinate through a graph-based workflow to handle different types of queries.

It uses GROQ model for local development and OpenAI model for deployment

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you must add **at least one** model configuration (OpenAI or Groq) to your `.env` file.

#### To use OpenAI model:  
`OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` = `<your_openai_model_name>`  
`OPENAI_API_KEY` = `<your_openai_api_key>`

## API Reference

#### Ask something

```http
  POST /chat
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| `question` | `string` | **Required**. Your question |

If you asked general question not related to PokÃ©mon, it will answer you directly.

If you asked question about some stats of a PokÃ©mon, it will answer with its stats if the PokÃ©mon exist.

If you asked some question about PokÃ©mon analysis or battle scenarios, or any other pokemon questions it will give you an answer and the reasoning.

| Question example | Agent triggered     | Answer                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| What is the capital of France | Direct answer (supervisor) | `{"answer": "The capital of France is Paris."}` |
| What are the base stats of Charizard?| Researcher Agent | `{"name": "charizard", "base_stats": {"hp": 78, "attack": 84, "defense": 78, "special_attack": 109, "special_defense": 85, "speed": 100}}` |
| Who would win in a battle, Pikachu or Bulbasaur? | Pokemon Expert Agent | `{"answer": "Pikachu has an electric-type advantage over Bulbasaur, so it would likely win.", "reasoning": "Electric-type moves are strong against Water and Flying-types, but Bulbasaur is Grass/Poison. However, Pikachu has higher speed and access to strong electric moves."}` |
| Who would win in a battle, Pikachu or Stonehedge? | Pokemon Expert Agent | `{"answer": "ANSWER_IMPOSSIBLE", "reasoning": "Could not analyze the query due to invalid PokÃ©mon. Please check the spelling of PokÃ©mon names."}` |

- **Error (500)**: Returns an error message if something goes wrong during processing.

#### Battle endpoint

```http
  GET /battle?pokemon1={pokemon1_name}?pokemon2={pokemon2_name}
```

| Parameter | Type     | Description                       |
| :-------- | :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `pokemon1`      | `string` | **Required**. First pokemon in the battle |
| `pokemon2`      | `string` | **Required**. Second pokemon in the battle |

Ask Battle Expert Agent to return a predicted winner of the battle. It gets each pokemon types strength and weaknesses and base stats, and predicts a winner.

| Pokemon1 example | Pokemon2 example     | Answer example                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
| Pikachu | Bulbasaur | `{"winner": "Pikachu", "reasoning": "Pikachu has a higher base speed and access to strong electric moves, which are effective against Bulbasaur."}` |
| Pikachu | Stonehedge | `{"winner": "BATTLE_IMPOSSIBLE", "reasoning": "Could not analyze the battle due to invalid PokÃ©mon. Please check the spelling of PokÃ©mon names."}` |

- **Error (500)**: Returns an error message if something goes wrong during processing.





## Troubleshooting
- Common Issues:
  - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
  - Verify that all dependencies are installed by checking the `requirements.txt` file.

- Error Messages:
  - If you encounter errors, check the application logs for detailed error messages and stack traces.

## Running Tests
- To run unittests, run:
```bash
  make test-unittests
```

OR 

```bash
  pytest -v -m "not integration"
```


- To run integration tests, run:
`> NOTE: Integration tests may fail on models other than gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 due to LLM unpredictability ðŸ™‚`

```bash
  make test-integration
```

OR

```bash
  pytest -v -m integration
```

- To run both, run:
```bash
  make tests
```

OR

```bash
  pytest -v
```

- To get test coverage, run:
```bash
  make coverage
```

OR
